# F1M Script Manager

**Requirements :**  
Python 3

**Safety :**  
Always make a copy of your save before running a script in case something goes wrong.

**Setup :**  
If you have changed your save file location, change `save_location` in `script_manager.py` to `save_location="<FilePath>"` and add change all `\` to `\\`

**How to use :**  
1. Launch `script_manager.py` and save your game (the order doesn't matter).  
2. Choose which script to run, the save you want to run it on and specify an argument for the scripts that require one.
3. Load your save.

Feel free to make your own scripts and send them to me if you want them to be included in this repository.

===============================================

### How to use the scripts

`change_team.py` : specify the name of the new team you want to manage as an argument (ex : Ferrari, McLaren, Alpha Tauri).  
`edit_drs.py` : specify the drs strength you want as an argument. Accepted values are "default", "reduced" and "disabled".  
`edit_grip.py` : specifiy the tyre behaviour you want as an argument. Accepted values are "default", "grip-", "durability-" and "both-".  
`shuffle_calendar.py` : run it before the first race of the season to shuffle the race calendar.  
`shuffle_engines.py` : run it before starting the new season if you want to know the new values before choosing a new engine or before the first race of the season if you want to be surprised.  

`set_sprint.py` and `set_race.py`:  
1. Save your game before starting the Imola/Austria/Brazil race weekends.
2. Run `set_sprint.py`.
3. Play the weekend with the sprint race.
4. Start the next race weekend at the same track but DO NOT START FP1 and save your game.
5. Run `set_race.py`.
6. Load your save and play the race.

**Known issues :**
Any driver not using 2 different tyre compounds during the sprint will show up as disqualified.
The standings are corrected properly when `set_race.py` is ran.
